# Google-Foobar-challenge

In case you have been living under a rock, let me tell you what Google Foobar is, it's a [very cool] hidden challenge by Google, which invites you to participate directly from the search page. It has 5 levels, with increasing difficulty and a very generous time limit for each problem. 

My language of preferrence is python, although it can completed either using pytthon or java!
I'm uploading my code for educational purpose *only*. The codes will be uploaded periodically so not to upset folks at Google!

Level 1
* Solar Doomsday
